## ⚛️ React Concepts Used

This project covers important **React fundamentals**:

- **`useState` Hook** → Manage step navigation and toggle visibility.
- **`Props`** → Pass values like `title`, `text`, `bgColor`, `textColor`, and `onClick` to components.
- **`Children` Prop** → Reusable `Button` component receives JSX (`👈 Previous`, `Next 👉`) as `children`.
- **`Conditional Rendering`** → Show/Hide the stepper with `isOpen` state.
- **`Dynamic Classes`** → Apply `"active"` class to highlight current steps.
- **`Component Reusability`** → `Button` component used for both Next and Previous with different props.
